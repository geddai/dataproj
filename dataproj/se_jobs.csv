Software Engineer,$63K-$127K (Glassdoor Est.),"A BIT ABOUT US
Lever was founded eight years ago to tackle the most strategic challenge that companies face: how to recruit and hire top talent. We’re building the next generation of hiring software that companies like Netflix, Cirque du Soleil, Shopify, and Eventbrite rely on to grow their teams. We've rethought the talent acquisition paradigm and are the innovation leaders in our space and looking for the right people to join us as we scale.

We’re extraordinarily proud of the company we’ve built so far (not to mention humbled to be recognized as the #1 place to work in San Francisco, as well as a top workplace in the entire United States). Our people are Lever’s biggest competitive advantage and we’ll continue investing in our “Leveroos” and people-first culture.

THE OPPORTUNITY
As an Engineer on our Product team, you’ll help us build out our core product by developing high-impact, user-facing features. In our growing engineering organization, you’ll be developing and shipping new features and updates to Lever’s product. You’ll be learning about our real-time web stack UI frameworks that help us deliver a beautiful and high quality solution to our customers. You’ll work collaboratively with product managers and designers to drive the implementation and release of major features, and be a champion of best practices for writing well-tested, well-organized code.

You’ll become familiar with all parts of our stack—including our open source web framework, DerbyJS. You will exercise judgment in making tradeoffs between design and feasibility. You’ll engineer your features to be scalable and resilient in a complex, single-page application.

We believe that user-centric design ultimately leads to the best products, so we listen closely to our users, both external and internal. As an engineer on our close-knit, cross-functional team, you’ll be an active voice in shaping our product. Lever is constantly rolling out high-demand features and tackling ever greater challenges of scale.

THE TEAM
You’ll join a team where everyone—including you—is striving to constantly improve their knowledge of infrastructure, systems, and cares about minimizing downtime. We are an incredibly supportive team–we love to pitch in when problems arise and give great peer feedback to help each other grow. We are passionate about lots of things--automation, friendly chat bots, creating a great hiring experience, and a great user experience--and we love sharing those passions with each other.

Read about what our team values and why here.

THE TECH STACK
Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

Essential Functions and Job Responsibilities:
Provide comprehensive operational and maintenance support to three MARFORRES web based application systems: 1) Memorandum Fiscal Services (MFS); 2) Training, Exercise and Employment Program (TEEP), Transportation of people, and transportation of things (T3); and MFR Manpower. Below is a brief description of each of the applications.

MFS is the primary MARFORES financial system used to integrate diverse data from external systems. MFS delivers a wide span of support covering multiple functional areas within the MARFORRES financial community such as the following: budgeting support, authorization funding management, conference request routing, unit travel card processing, transactional research/validation, financial reporting, billing reconciliation, Defense Travel System account management, and evaluation assessments. MFS is a web based system supporting more than 500 active users throughout the continental United States in support of the MARFORRES financial community. MFS is an ever-evolving financial tool designed to provide accurate and expedient budgeting and accounting information to assist managers in making informed decisions effecting the command’s financial posture. With Business Process Reengineering as the main focus of MFS, the system is designed to fill capability gaps, automate and streamline workflows, and provide integrated reporting capabilities. MFS is agile and able to adapt quickly to the changing DoD financial landscape as new requirements and policy changes must be incorporated into the system to ensure compliancy. MFS is a primary facilitating system for MARFORRES in audit support by offering document retention and rapid retrieval capabilities. MFS has three major external data feeds and two additional internal data exchanges which are processed daily from these Marine Corps systems: SMARTS, MROWS, and GCSS-MC. Currently there are 4 data exchanges, 3 are one-directional (incoming) and one interface is bi-directional. Once the data is received, MFS runs an integration processing job to prepare this data for end users every morning. On average annually, the MFS programming cycle includes 3-4 major projects (greater than two weeks design phase – 4 weeks in the development phase) and roughly 8 minor projects (under two weeks in duration). The new development requirements range from cosmetic modifications to major modular rewrites based on the prioritization of the MARFORRES MFS Configuration Control Board. In addition, there are several items that fall outside of the normal System Development Life Cycle that require support such as: COOP preparation, ADHOC reporting support, system/network troubleshooting, and tasks required to maintain the system’s Authority to Operate (ATO). The contractor should be familiar with T-SQL DB and ASP.NET Web Forms in VB to work within the MFS program.

T3 is a web based system designed to be a Commander’s TEEP management and transportation management tool, capable of identifying unit, personnel, equipment, and resources prior to the execution of training exercises or deployments COMMARFORRES is responsible for the training and the operational readiness of 39,000 Marine Reservists. MARFORRES G-3/5 is responsible for managing a financial database that integrates Operating Budgets with training and exercises, which result in resource utilization over time. Resources are defined as units and their associated personnel, equipment, and funding. The MARFORRES G-3/5 Department provides budgeting, accounting, execution and financial support services through the T3 Database to four Major Subordinate Commands (4th Marine Aircraft Wing, 4th Marine Division, 4th Marine Logistics Group, and the Force Headquarters Group) in addition to many major programs managed at the headquarter level. A major challenge facing the MARFORRES G-3/5 is the geographical dispersion of the more than 160 sites throughout the United States.

The MFR IRR Management Application is a web based system designed to maintain accurate and current personnel records on members of the Individual Ready Reserve Components, to include mailing address, physical condition, military qualifications, dependency status, civilian occupational skills, availability for service, and other information that is needed to determine strength levels of the Military Services. Below outlines the current operating environment for this task area:

Currently Microsoft Visual Studio is used to develop the code, and Azure DevOps server for version control, testing and release management capabilities. The development team in coordination with the Marine Forces Reserve Server/Network personnel to conduct the user acceptance testing, performance, and load testing of the applications. Release notes are published to the home page of each application. Currently there are no set monthly release scheduled for changes to production. In the current environment MFR follows an agile schema, sprints are anywhere from 2-6 weeks, and depends on the complexity of the project.

The demands on each application translate to a functionality backlog of 50-100 items varying in levels of complexity. Each program manager operates on a continuous agile development schedule producing new functionality at least once a month. Our software engineers receives roughly on average of 10 tickets per month; most are for minor bugs or cosmetic changes. Non “bug” tickets are required to be presented to each applications Configuration Control Board (CCB). Out of the 10 tickets, about 2-3 requests per week ranging from simple bug fixes or cosmetic adjustments; major rewrites range from about (1-2 per year). Each application must also be updated to meet current technology platform changes which equate to major re-writes every three years on average.

MFS has roughly 500-600 active daily users, T3 has approximately 300 active daily users, and MFR Manpower has approximately 200. MFS has right at 150,000 lines of code, while MFR Manpower has approximately 12,000; T3 system has approximately 100,000. In addition to the number of lines of codes, each system has a code quality range, which ranges from adequate to exceptional. These are mature systems which needs to be maintained while at the same time prepare to update to new technologies and help develop new features.
